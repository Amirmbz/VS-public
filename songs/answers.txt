The average energy, valence, and danceability of the listener's top 100 songs are respectively: 0.65906, 0.484443, 0.71646
In regard to characterizing the listener's taste, I could say that the listener enjoys high-energy and danceable songs.
But if we look at the other factors in the database we notice that the average speechiness is about 0.115, and the average tempo is 120, which is considerably high.
Hence, we can judge other characteristics of the listeners by looking at all the factors in the database.
I also assumed that it could be helpful to visualize the top songs but in this case, it didn't vary enough to do that.
